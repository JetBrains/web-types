# Web-Types

Welcome to Web-Types, a JSON format for documenting web component libraries.

Web-Types is a framework-agnostic format aimed at providing IDEs and other tools with the metadata information about the contents 
of a component library. Its powerful name patterns allow encoding information about web framework syntax or
customizing code completion suggestions for large icon libraries in the IDEs that support Web-Types.

# Version 2.0 of the format

Web-Types started as a format to support Vue libraries, but we've always wanted to provide a more generic solution. 
Finally, version 2.0 of Web-Types format works seamlessly for any kind of web framework, 
Web Components library, or CSS icons pack.

A detailed documentation of the format is available [here](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/websymbols-web-types.html)

Starting with version 2021.3.1 of [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) (and other [JetBrains IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com/products/#lang=js&type=ide)), a full support for the new Web-Types format 
is supported (the new format has been partially supported since 2021.2). You can now add custom HTML elements and 
attributes, custom CSS classes, properties, functions, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements. Vue and Angular support 
integrates fully with the format, so you can easily mix Web Components in Angular or Vue templates.

Example Web-Types files are available in `examples` folder. Web-Types for Angular and Vue frameworks are available
in the `examples/references` directory. They require dynamic contributions based on project source from IDE plugins 
to work properly. 

A webinar recording with Piotr Tomiak explaining the new version of the format and how pattern processing works is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkAhI1YyU0w).

The new version of Web-Types is backward compatible with the Vue-only Web-Types.

# Local development with Web-Types

To enable your Web-Types file in the project, link it through the `web-types` property of your local project `package.json` file.
You can specify multiple Web-Types files by providing an array of paths.

# Distribution

Library providers are welcome to include detailed Web-Types JSONs and link them through `web-types`
property in `package.json`. E.g.:
```
{
  ...
  "web-types": "./web-types.json"
  ...
}
```
Many libraries are providing this feature, for instance:
 * Vue.js
   * vuetify (https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/pull/9440)
   * quasar (https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/pull/4749)
   * bootstrap-vue (https://github.com/bootstrap-vue/bootstrap-vue/pull/4110)
   * nuxt.js (https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/pull/7611)
   * @ionic/vue (https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/pull/22428)

In case a library is not shipping Web Types, they can be published under the `@web-types` scope on NPM. 
Currently, the following frameworks and libraries are supported in such a way:
 * Vue.js
    * quasar-framework
 * Web Components
   * lit

Published JSONs are checked into this repository under the `packages` folder. In case of Web-Types published to `@web-types` scope, 
IDEs are supposed to download required JSONs without any changes to the user project structure.

Various IDEs perform optimizations when scanning `node_modules` directory, so to ensure that `web-types` for 
your package are always available, make sure it's listed in `packages/registry.json`.

# Schema

Web-Types JSON Schema is available in the `schema` folder. Use one of the following URLs to reference it in your JSON files:
```
http://json.schemastore.org/web-types
```
or
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JetBrains/web-types/master/schema/web-types.json
```

# Generating Web-Types

### From source

Currently, the following component documentation formats are supported:
- JSDoc using [styleguidist](https://vue-styleguidist.github.io/docs/Documenting.html#code-comments) `vue-docgen-api`
  library - add [`vue-docgen-web-types`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-docgen-web-types) package to your project 
  and run the `vue-docgen-web-types` command. You can launch it in a watch mode by passing `--watch` and 
  you can pass a custom configuration file via `--configFile` parameter. 
  See [config.d.ts](https://github.com/JetBrains/web-types/blob/master/gen/vue-docgen-web-types/types/config.d.ts)
  for detailed information on supported configuration file options.
  
If you're not using JSDoc in your project, you can create your own builder for `web-types` JSON. For examples see
vuetify, quasar or bootstrap-vue pull requests from above.

# Publishing to `@web-types` scope

We welcome your PRs with Web-Types for libraries in `packages` folder. There should be a single file per library in the format:

```
packages/<pkg-name>/<pkg-name>@<pkg-version>.web-types.json
```

We are syncing contents of the `packages` folder using `script/publish.sh` script which usage syntax is following:
```
publish.sh <package-name> [--dry-run]
```
The script scans folder `packages/<package-name>` for provided Web-Types jsons and synchronizes
contents with NPM.

# Versioning and naming of `@web-types` scope
Versioning and naming rules are as follows:
* Web-Types for package `pkg-name` are available under `@web-types/pkg-name`
* Web-Types for package `@scope/pkg-name` are available under `@web-types/at-scope-pkg-name`
* Web-Types for version `1.2.3` are published as prerelease `1.2.3-n`, e.g. `1.2.3-3`
* Web-Types for pre-release version `1.2.3-rc.1` are published with additional segment, 
  e.g. `1.2.3-rc.1.3`
* to search for appropriate Web-Types package use range `<pkg-ver` and include prerelease versions, 
  e.g. to find Web-Types for version `1.2.6`, query package list with `<1.2.6`, which can match 
  Web-Types in version `1.2.4-12` 
* all outdated versions are marked as deprecated and should be ignored by an IDE

# Contributions

All contributions are welcome! We need your help to improve the Web-Types format specification,
to support other frameworks and to improve quality of generated metadata through scripts.
